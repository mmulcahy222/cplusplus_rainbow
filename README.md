It's 2021. I've been doing software development since I was 5, started again at 17 and never looked back since. And after all this damn time....I finally did C++. I wanted to know the bleeding edge best, and to level my game up outside of easy abstracted languages like Python & JavaScript. I realize the possibilities of C++ are near endless, and the fact that it's a level above assembly/metal is highly alluring. Serious tools & software like Amazon AWS Hyperplane are in C++ and in order to make the tools in the data center or routing protocols, what better way than to struggle in C++. 

This is 300 lines of C++ to make moving rainbow C++ much more faster than anything in Python & JavaScript. Worth the struggle.

Interesting ideas is to have the mouse influence the waves, or to make other moving plots/shapes
